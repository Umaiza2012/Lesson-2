            <em> Failure is a word unknown to me </em>

            <p> <b> Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25<sup>th</sup> December, 1876.</b> He was a barrister,
            politician, and the founder of Pakistan. <em> Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947,</em> and then as the Republic of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England.<mark> Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court,</mark> and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
            In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.<strong> Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League,</strong> and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it
            agreed to follow a <small>campaign of satyagraha,</small> which he regarded as <i>political anarchy.</i></p>
